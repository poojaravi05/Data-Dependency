# 474-Project1
Project 1: Data Dependency

Description:
Project which checks Data Dependenies(Flow Dependency, Anti Dependency, Output Dependency) between the set of instructions, so that we can conclude which set of instructions can be executed in parallel. This helps to optimize the execution time and number of processes used.

Programming language used: C++

Tools used:
  Tuffix environment
  Visual studio Code
  
Execution Steps:
  1. Start Visual Studio Code in Tuffix/Ubuntu
  2. Open the code file(DataDependency.cpp) in VS Code
  3. Run the program:
      Click the play button at the top right corner.
      Then select C/C++: g++ build and debug active file from the dropdown.
      Check the terminal for output.
  4. Execution through terminal:
      g++ filename.cpp - Compile
      ./a.out - Execute


To get the output for only Algo Verify:
    Can Change the block instruction inputs in the main function, meanwhile Commentting the lines 177, 185, 186 and 187
    
To get the output of only Algo Calculate:
    Can change the block instruction and simple instruction inputs in the main function, Commentting the lines 180, 181 and 182
